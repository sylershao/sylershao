## Hi there 👋

I'm **Sylershao**, a PhD student focusing on **AI-powered drug design** with strong interests in **graph theory** and **natural language processing (NLP)**.

---

### 🚀 What I'm working on  
- Applying AI to revolutionize traditional drug design workflows  
- Exploring the intersection of **graph theory**, **NLP**, and **computational pharmacology**  

---

### 📚 What I'm currently learning  
- Designing user-friendly **human-AI interaction interfaces** for traditional pharmacologists  

---

### 🤝 Looking to collaborate on  
I'm eager to collaborate with **traditional pharmacologists** to combine domain knowledge with **AI-driven tools**, helping streamline and improve drug design — especially by eliminating those time-consuming, headache-inducing parts (within legal bounds, of course 😉).

---

### 🧠 Areas where I need help  
- Building interactive **molecular graph visualization** tools for drug molecules  

---

### 💬 Ask me about  
I'm still learning — but feel free to talk to me about:  
- **NLP**, **drug design**, **graph theory**, **model optimization**, **mathematical questions**  
- Or just chat about the ups and downs of doing research 🎓
